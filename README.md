This project is a Python class that allows you to calculate the minimum variance portfolio with positive weights for a given list of crypto currencies, using the Yahoo Finance API. The class allows you to specify a start and end date for the historical prices of the crypto currencies, and returns a mapping from column names to weights for the optimal portfolio (+ expected daily return and standard deviation for each currency). The class also includes an additional feature that allows you to pass a target return value, and returns a portfolio with target return values with minimum variance if it is feasible.
